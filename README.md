Hi, I'm Hung. I'm a last-year student in Digital Systems and Design @Aalto University and cloud-native software development intern @Nokia. My work mainly revolves around distributed systems, cloud-native digital twins, and chaos engineering.

I'm currently learning more about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I'm also trying to spend more time contributing to open-source projects in my free time.

You can reach me at hung.h.vu@aalto.fi.
